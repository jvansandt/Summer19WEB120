<h2>HTML Galleries and jQuery Sliders</h2>
    
<p>If your site is presenting images, whether as a portfolio or just to show off a few major features at the top of your page, a gallery or slider can be created for your site to cleanly display them in a way that will impress visitors or present a fashionable exhibit.</p>
    
<p>There are many jQuery sliders to choose from, giving flexible options and a lot of customization with little to no effort. Some offer a plethora of animations, are built to be responsive, or come as plugins for Wordpress (Top 50 JQuery). Sliders provided by jQuery are great for mobile use, where users have a more limited space to view content, and can accomodate touch swiping and preload a number of images defined by the designer so only upcoming images will take up bandwidth.</p>

<p>HTML galleries, designed in mostly CSS and/or javascript, are much the same as jQuery sliders. Galleries are more appropriate for showing off a portfolio and displaying many pictures at the same time, while a slider is better to show one or a few images at a time and have transitions between them (Top 10 Galleries). If using this option, the web designer may have more options to manage the code, though many premade options are very flexible.</p>
