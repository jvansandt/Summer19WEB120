<h2>Making a Decision between Mobile Apps and a Responsive Website</h2>
    
<p>When determining whether your time, money, or other resources should be spent on a mobile application or on a responsive website, there is a lot to consider. For a business that the user may not have heard of before it may be unreasonable to require them to go to your mobile application, because it takes time to download and uses up space which may be scarce (Garbar, responsive-website-vs). Creating a website for your business before, and in addition to, an app lets the user easily search for and browse your content. Once you’ve established a relationship with the customer, they can then go to your app where they can more easily access frequently used features or get status updates such as through push notifications.</p>
    
<p>If you can’t spend the resources on both a website and an app then a responsive website is doing to be the most accessible option for users. One can access a site through either their desktop or mobile device and use any browser they wish, granted your site is properly built to be supported by them, while users are largely split between iOS and Android so you need to develop the app separately for both of them. However, if you still want to do an app, there are options for hybrid and cross-platform app development which can greatly increase the amount of code shared between the different mobile platforms.</p>
    
<p>How the user interacts with your product is also a major factor to consider. If the person is going to your site frequently to accomplish a singular goal, such as checking for regular status updates, simply pressing one button on their mobile device is efficient and convenient. For those who will spend time browsing multiple features, a website can afford a wider range of options. When making both a website and app, remember that a “mobile application doesn’t have to fully duplicate features of the responsive site” (Responsive Website vs Mobile App: Comparison).</p>
    
<p>In short, the greatest consideration is how people will be using your site, and how often. Frequent use of specific features is done very well on an easy to use app, while less frequent and more broad usage may be better on a responsive website. Even if one option is clearly the superior option for you and your users, building a responsive site first will help build trust and reach more users due to its accessibility, which you can then use to direct frequent users to an application!
