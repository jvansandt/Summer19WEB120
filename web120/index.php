 <p>Hey! My name is Joseph, and this is my second year in Seattle for school. I relocated here from Oklahoma last summer to pursue an education and job in web design. I'm a bit of a gamer and nerd, so you can usually find me at home on my computer, often spending time online with my girlfriend who currently lives in L.A.</p>
 <p>I'm also a veteran of 7 years in the Navy. My job was as an electriction on jet aircraft, and I left because I decided that wasn't what I wanted to do as a career.</p>
 <p>Noodles are some of my favorite foods in the area, it really makes me miss my time stationed in Japan!</p>

 <p>I hope you enjoy penguins! I will be using various penguin images as placeholders. I don't often get pictures of myself, so I will need to look around or take some.</p>
